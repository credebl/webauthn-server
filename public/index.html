    <h1>FIDO Details</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>What is FIDO?</h2>
      <p>FIDO (Fast Identity Online) is a set of open authentication standards that enable passwordless and multi-factor authentication. It aims to provide secure and easy-to-use authentication methods to protect user accounts and data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How FIDO Works</h2>
      <p>FIDO uses a combination of public-key cryptography and biometric authentication to verify user identities. It involves the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>User initiates authentication with the service provider.</li>
        <li>Service provider sends a challenge to the user.</li>
        <li>User's device creates a new public-private key pair for this session.</li>
        <li>User's device securely signs the challenge with the private key.</li>
        <li>The signed challenge is sent back to the service provider.</li>
        <li>Service provider verifies the signature using the user's public key.</li>
        <li>If the verification is successful, the user is authenticated.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Benefits of FIDO</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Eliminates the need for passwords, reducing the risk of password-related attacks.</li>
        <li>Provides strong security through public-key cryptography.</li>
        <li>Supports various authentication methods, including fingerprint, facial recognition, and hardware tokens.</li>
        <li>Improves user experience with quick and seamless authentication.</li>
        <li>Reduces the burden of password management for users.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>FIDO Standards</h2>
      <p>FIDO has developed two main sets of standards:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>FIDO UAF (Universal Authentication Framework): Enables passwordless authentication using biometrics or other user-specific data.</li>
        <li>FIDO U2F (Universal Second Factor): Provides an additional layer of security through two-factor authentication using hardware tokens.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Adoption and Support</h2>
      <p>FIDO authentication is being widely adopted by various industries and service providers to enhance security and user experience. Many modern web browsers and platforms offer built-in support for FIDO standards, making it accessible to a broad range of users.</p>
